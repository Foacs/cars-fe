## Code format

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). You can configure IntelliJ to use it via its plugin:

- In `IntelliJ IDEA`, open `File` > `Settings`
- In the `Settings` menu, select `Plugins` on the left
- Search for `Prettier` on the `Marketplace`
- Click on the `Install` button

It is also recommended to automatically run `Prettier` on `Reformat code` action and on save:

- In `IntelliJ IDEA`, open `File` > `Settings`
- In the `Settings` menu, select `Languages & Frameworks` > `JavaScript` > `Prettier` on the left
- Tick the `On 'Reformat code' action` and `On save` checkboxes

## Commit guidelines

Our guidelines for committing changes to the project are as follows:

* Use the imperative, present tense form of the action. e.g. `Change` not `Changes` nor `Changed`
* Capitalize the first letter of the `subject` (see [structure](#commit-message-structure))
* No period at the end

### Commit message structure

The commit message should be in the following format:

```
<type>: <subject> <icon>
```

Where:

* `<type>` is one of the following:
    * `feat`: Relates to a feature
    * `fix`: Bug fixing
    * `docs`: Documentation changes
    * `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (e.g. formatting)
    * `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor impacts any feature
    * `perf`: Code change that improves performance
    * `test`: Test creation or fixing
    * `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
    * `ci`: Changes to our continuous integration system
    * `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries
    * `revert`: Reverts a previous commit
* `<subject>` is a short description of the change
* `<icon>` is an emoticon that represents the `<type>` of change:
    * `feat`: ✨ (`:sparkles:`)
    * `fix`: 🐛 (`:bug:`)
    * `docs`: 📚 (`:books:`)
    * `style`: 💎 (`:gem:`)
    * `refactor`: 📦 (`:package:`)
    * `perf`: 🚀 (`:rocket:`)
    * `test`: 🚨 (`:rotating_light:`)
    * `build`: 🛠 (`:hammer_and_wrench:`)
    * `ci`:⚙️ (`:gear:`) 
    * `chore`: ♻️ (`:recycle:`)
    * `revert`: 🗑 (`:wastebasket:`)
